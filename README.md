# V2I-GridCalib
The core mission of V2I-GridCalib is to provide a robust and accurate 6-DoF pose estimate of a vehicle within the coordinate frame of a roadside unit (RSU) on-the-fly, without the need for pre-deployed targets. Our framework uniquely addresses the critical challenge of observational scale mismatch in dynamic urban environments.
